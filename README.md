# TheRollingStones-webPage
Informative basic WebPage about The Rolling Stones.
This webpage is designed in HTML and stylized with CSS, work done by Roberto Mindrila.
The webpage was one of my first works in the world of coding, and its not optimized, and thats because the aim of the page was the look and not the performance.

Note: The page might not be shown in the real size in any device, except a computer with a 1920x1080 resolution screen.
Note: The page has a very basic design and the language it is done is Spanish.
