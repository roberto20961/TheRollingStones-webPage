# TheRollingStones-webPage
Informative basic WebPage about The Rolling Stones.
This webpage is designed in HTML and stylized with CSS, work done by Roberto Mindrila.
The webpage was one of my first works in the world of coding, and its not optimized, and thats because the aim of the page was the look and not the performance.

Note: The page might not be shown in the real size in any device, except a computer with a 1920x1080 resolution screen.
Note: The page has a very basic design and it is done Spanish.

The page work-system is very easy to understand:
1. 'index.html' is the main page, the one which pops out when you click the webpage, and it is the parent directory.
2. The branch called 'web' is the directory where we can find the four main elements which build the webpage: 'inicio.html', 'conciertos.html', 'discografia.html' and 'formularios.html'.
3. The branch called 'css' is indeed the CSS written stylesheet of every single element of the webpage.
4. The branch 'images' has got every image that has been used to desing the webpage.
